Nella macro del bottone che esegue i comandi, a monte di tutto:  
  Application.ScreenUpdating = False
  Application.EnableEvents = False
  Application.DisplayStatusBar = False
  Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual
    ...
  Application.ScreenUpdating = True
  Application.EnableEvents = True
  Application.DisplayStatusBar = True
  Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAuto
  

Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual 
turns off auto-calculations. 
This is essential when your workbook has a lot of formulas and you are transferring new data to these cells.

Application.ScreenUpdating = False 
turns off screen updating. 
Excel will constantly be updating the screen when you run your procedures unnecessarily. This can be a big hit on performance. It is much more efficient to update the screen once your code is finished.

Application.DisplayStatusBar = False 
turns off the status bar. 
If you do not need to show users the different statuses while code is running, it is a good idea to just turn this off.

Application.DisplayAlerts = False turns off messages and alerts when code is running.
If you are running a process that would normally cause Excel to display an alert to the user,
you can set this to false if you do not want the user to see alerts.

ActiveSheet.DisplayPageBreaks = False 
turns off Excelâ€™s recalculation of page breaks each time the count of rows or columns is modified.
